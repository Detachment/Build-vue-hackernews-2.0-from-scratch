Welcome to my first application bulid tutorial: **Bulid vue-hackernews-2.0 from Scratch**.

As a new learner of vue.js, I find it a bit difficult to understand the offical example: vue-hackernews-2.0. Meanwhile, the complexity of this example really attracts me. So I spend some time on figuring out how it works and with tutorial I will bulid it step-by-step.

**Note that this tutorial is for beginners.** I will divide this tutorial into serval chapters, each of then represent different step of the whole process. In the head of every chapter, I would list some basic understandings acquired.

The code of this tutorial works on Windows, other OS haven't been tested.

Notice: Vue-HN is short for vue-hackernews-2.0 in all the after chapters to help us save some keystrokes.
