# 1. Webpack, Vue.js, Vue-router, Vuex and Hackernews API

## Preface

In this chapter, we will bulid another edition of Vue-HN in which we would start to make this project more modularized and maintainable. With some very basic configurations of webpack, we would make this edition of the project work. In order to bulid the whole project step by step, we still did not consider server, SSR(server-side-render), cache and so on in this edition.
So, the following animation screenshot would show us the basic functions in this edition and some simple deconstruction of the project.
