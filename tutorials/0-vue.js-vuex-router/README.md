## 0. Vue.js, vuex, Vue-router, Hackernews API, Firebase and ES6

As a new learner of front-end developer, ever since I started to learn Vue-HN project, I wondered whether it is possible to make this project with just vue.js, vuex and vue-router. After some tries and failures, I finally made it. The GIFs below are the animation screenshots of the offical edition and my edition respectively.

As we can see, almost all the features that existed in the offical example can also be implemented with just vue.js and its ecosystem. Before you start with this chapter, you should acquire some knowledge listed as below:
- [Vue.js 2.0: The Progressive JavaScript Framework](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vue-router 2.0: A Simple Router for Vue.js](https://router.vuejs.org/en/)
- [Vuex 2.0: State Management Patter and Library for Vue.js Application ](http://vuex.vuejs.org/en/)
- [Hacker News API: HackerNews API Works with Firebase](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
- [Learn ES2015: A detailed overview of ECMAScript 2015 features](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/)
- [Firebase: App success made simple](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)

Don't get dizzy when you see so many lists, because apart from the vue.js and its ecosystem, you just need to know a little about the others. Take ES6 for example, it is enough if you have ever used arrow function, Promise and some other basic features.
