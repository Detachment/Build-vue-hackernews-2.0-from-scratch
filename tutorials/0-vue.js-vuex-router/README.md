## 0. Vue.js, vuex, Vue-router, Hackernews API, Firebase and ES6

As a new learnner of front-end developer, ever since I started to learn Vue-HN project, I wondered whether it is possible to make this project with just vue.js, vuex and vue-router. After some tries and failures, I finally made it. The GIFs below are the animation screenshots of the offical edition and my edition respectively.
